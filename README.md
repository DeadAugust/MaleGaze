files for "Male Gaze (2018)" a face tracking dildo on pan tilt servo motor using a p5 sketch running PoseNet

Three things need to be run on the laptop for the dildo servo to work:
1) the p5 sketch running poseNet (p5poseNet folder)
2) the P5.serialcontrol app (instructions below)
3) the arduino (maleGaze.ino)

To install P5.serialcontrol, follow the instructions here:
